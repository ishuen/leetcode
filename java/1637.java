// 1637. Widest Vertical Area Between Two Points Containing No Points
// Given n points on a 2D plane where points[i] = [xi, yi], Return the widest vertical area between two points such that no points are inside the area.
//
// A vertical area is an area of fixed-width extending infinitely along the y-axis (i.e., infinite height). The widest vertical area is the one with the maximum width.
//
// Note that points on the edge of a vertical area are not considered included in the area.
//
// Example 1:
//
// â€‹
// Input: points = [[8,7],[9,9],[7,4],[9,7]]
// Output: 1
// Explanation: Both the red and the blue area are optimal.
// Example 2:
//
// Input: points = [[3,1],[9,0],[1,0],[1,4],[5,3],[8,8]]
// Output: 3
//
//
// Constraints:
//
// n == points.length
// 2 <= n <= 105
// points[i].length == 2
// 0 <= xi, yi <= 109
