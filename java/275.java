// 275. H-Index II
// Given an array of integers citations where citations[i] is the number of citations a researcher received for their ith paper and citations is sorted in an ascending order, return compute the researcher's h-index.
//
// According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: A scientist has an index h if h of their n papers have at least h citations each, and the other n âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each.
//
// If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.
//
// You must write an algorithm that runs in logarithmic time.
//
//
//
// Example 1:
//
// Input: citations = [0,1,3,5,6]
// Output: 3
// Explanation: [0,1,3,5,6] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 0, 1, 3, 5, 6 citations respectively.
// Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.
// Example 2:
//
// Input: citations = [1,2,100]
// Output: 2
//
//
// Constraints:
//
// n == citations.length
// 1 <= n <= 105
// 0 <= citations[i] <= 1000
// citations is sorted in ascending order.
//
// Runtime: 0 ms, faster than 100.00% of Java online submissions for H-Index II.
// Memory Usage: 46.1 MB, less than 53.93% of Java online submissions for H-Index II.

    }
}
// index h = len - index mid 
// citations[len - h] >= h
// citations[len - (len - mid)] >= len - mid
// -> citations[mid] >= len - mid
