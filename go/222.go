// 222. Count Complete Tree Nodes

// Given the root of a complete binary tree, return the number of the nodes in the tree.

// According to Wikipedia, every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled in a complete binary tree, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.

// Design an algorithm that runs in less than O(n) time complexity.

 

// Example 1:


// Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
// Output: 6
// Example 2:

// Input: root = []
// Output: 0
// Example 3:

// Input: root = [1]
// Output: 1
 

// Constraints:

// The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 5 * 104].
// 0 <= Node.val <= 5 * 104
// The tree is guaranteed to be complete.

// Runtime 0 ms Beats 100.00%
// Memory 9.00 MB Beats 93.07%
